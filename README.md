# Workout Tracker

A web application to log running and cycling workouts on a map. Built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Leaflet library. Inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's course.

## Features

- **Map Integration**: Displays workout locations using the Leaflet library.
- **Running Workouts**: Logs distance, duration, cadence, and calculates pace.
- **Cycling Workouts**: Logs distance, duration, elevation gain, and calculates speed.
- **Automatic Descriptions**: Generates a description for each workout.
- **Local Storage**: Saves workouts to local storage for persistence.

## What I Learned

- Advanced JavaScript concepts and OOP principles
- Handling geolocation and integrating interactive maps
- Data persistence with local storage
